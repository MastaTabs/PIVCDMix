# PIV CDMix

This little gem was developed at Village Tronic Computer back in the day by a service technician,
after the audio circuits of the PicassoIV was chiseled in stone and had some short comings.

Using this board you can listen to CD and Amiga audio through the PIV audio output at the same time.

The design is proven and working.
